# Bird Watching Website

This is a project around making a bird watching website look as close
as possible to an example webpage. All of the HTML elements were given,
it was up to us to implement the proper CSS rules to design the page.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

There are no formal tests for this project. The best way to determine how
well this project is put together is to compare the webpage to the sample 
page given at the following link:
